# RISC-V-Tapeout-RTL-to-GDSII-Week-2
The RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program is a 20-week hands-on course guiding participants from RTL design to fabricated silicon. It covers synthesis, physical design, timing sign-off, verification, and chip validation using a 180 nm process. This week we get used to SoC reset, wavk-up and data flow.

üß† Open-Source System-on-Chip (SoC) ‚Äî RVMYTH Based

Sky130-based educational SoC built around the RVMYTH RISC-V core, integrating key digital and analog subsystems for learning, experimentation, and mixed-signal design exploration.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Components
RVMYTH CPU Core

Simple RISC-V processor implementing base integer instructions.

Manages booting, configuration, interrupts (ISR), and data transfer via DMA.

Acts as the main control and computation engine of the SoC.

Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)

Generates and stabilizes the system clock.

Supports clock multiplication/division (e.g., 50 MHz ‚Üí 500 MHz).

Reduces clock jitter and synchronizes multiple domains.

10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)

Converts digital values to analog voltages for real-world interfacing.

Equation: Vout = (D / (2^10 - 1)) √ó Vref

Supports R‚Äì2R Ladder DAC architecture (efficient for 10-bit resolution).
