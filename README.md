# RISC-V-Tapeout-RTL-to-GDSII-Week-2
The RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program is a 20-week hands-on course guiding participants from RTL design to fabricated silicon. It covers synthesis, physical design, timing sign-off, verification, and chip validation using a 180 nm process. This week we get used to SoC reset, waveup and data flow.
